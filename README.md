# [Calculator App](https://main.d32umybxq09b6x.amplifyapp.com/)

A fully responsive calculator application built using Javascript and React as the web framework. Using grid style CSS for the layout and react hooks and state, it acts and behaves like a calculator should - allowing the user to complete mathematical operations.

This responsive project was created by Steve Vance, Chris Fraser and James Fraser and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

The application is hosted on AWS Amplify.
