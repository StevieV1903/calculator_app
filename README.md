# [Calculator App](https://main.d32umybxq09b6x.amplifyapp.com/)

Snooker Scorer is a fully responsive web application that allows you to keep score during a snooker match, either if you are watching or playing with a friend. It includes a set-up page that inputs and stores players' names, lets you pick who is to break first and also lets the user decide how many frames the match will last for.

This responsive project was created by Steve Vance, Chris Fraser and James Fraser and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

The application is hosted on AWS Amplify.
